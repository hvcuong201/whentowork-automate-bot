This is my personal project. I work as a part-time student assistant at my school's makerspace. Our work requires the employees to use the website WhenToWork.com to publish the schedule preference weekly, but the process takes a lot of time because of the website's poor design. That gives me the idea of creating a bot to automate the task and then share it with my coworkers. This is also a learning opportunity for me to know more about Selenium WebDriver. 

## User Story:
Publishing a preference working hour for the week in WhenToWork.com takes many repetitive mouse events of clicking and dragging. 
It takes a great deal of time for the employee to register preference hours by interacting with the website interface.
My boss has to regularly ping everyone at the group chat to remind them of registering their preference hour for the week on the website.

* This application provide a neat interface for the user in instead of having to interact with the website. 
* Reduce the time for the task by automating multiple scenarios.
